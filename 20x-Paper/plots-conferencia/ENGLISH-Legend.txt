Heritability and Predictive Ability for LCH Traits. Each boxplot corresponds to one of the 21 LCH
color trait components in Solanum tuberosum Andigenum group. Traits are grouped by color feature (e.g.,
flower, sprout, skin, stem) and by component (Chroma: C, Hue: H, Lightness: L). A. Posterior distribu-
tions of narrow-sense heritability (h2), estimated using Bayesian Ridge Regression (BRR) with 15,000
iterations, 5,000 burn-in, and thinning every 5 steps. Posterior medians are annotated above each box.
B. Predictive abilities of seven genomic prediction models. Values represent the correlation between
observed phenotypes and GEBVs across repeated 5-fold cross-validation. The mean predictive ability is
shown above each boxplot, and the model achieving the best performance per trait is indicated below.
