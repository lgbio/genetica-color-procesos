@article{Bradbury2007,
abstract = {Summary: Association analyses that exploit the natural diversity of a genome to map at very high resolutions are becoming increasingly important. In most studies, however, researchers must contend with the confounding effects of both population and family structure. TASSEL (Trait Analysis by aSSociation, Evolution and Linkage) implements general linear model and mixed linear model approaches for controlling population and family structure. For result interpretation, the program allows for linkage disequilibrium statistics to be calculated and visualized graphically. Database browsing and data importation is facilitated by integrated middleware. Other features include analyzing insertions/deletions, calculating diversity statistics, integration of phenotypic and genotypic data, imputing missing data and calculating principal components.Availability: The TASSEL executable, user manual, example data sets and tutorial document are freely available at http://www.maizegenetics.net/tassel. The source code for TASSEL can be found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/tassel.Contact:pjb39@cornell.edu},

abstract = {Currently, algorithms and softwares for genetic analysis of diploid organisms with bi-allelic markers are well-established, while those for polyploids are limited. Here, we present SHEsisPlus, the online algorithm toolset for both dichotomous and quantitative trait genetic analysis on polyploid species (compatible with haploids and diploids, too). SHEsisPlus is also optimized for handling multiple-allele datasets. It{\^{a}} € s free, open source and also designed to perform a range of analyses, including haplotype inference, linkage disequilibrium analysis, epistasis detection, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and single locus association tests. Meanwhile, we developed an accurate and efficient haplotype inference algorithm for polyploids and proposed an entropy-based algorithm to detect epistasis in the context of quantitative traits. A study of both simulated and real datasets showed that our haplotype inference algorithm was much faster and more accurate than existing ones. Our epistasis detection algorithm was the first try to apply information theory to characterizing the gene interactions in quantitative trait datasets. Results showed that its statistical power was significantly higher than conventional approaches.},

@article{Tan2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} Crop Science Society of America. Most human diseases and agriculturally important traits are complex. Dissecting their genetic architecture requires continued  development of innovative and powerful statistical methods. Corresponding advances in computing tools are critical to efficiently use these statistical innovations and to enhance and accelerate biomedical and agricultural research and applications. The genome association and prediction integrated tool (GAPIT) was first released in 2012 and became widely used for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genomic prediction. The GAPIT implemented computationally efficient statistical methods, including the compressed mixed linear model (CMLM) and genomic prediction by using genomic best linear unbiased prediction (gBLUP). New state-of-the-art statistical methods have now been implemented in a new, enhanced version of GAPIT. These methods include factored spectrally transformed linear mixed models (FaST-LMM), enriched CMLM (ECMLM), FaST-LMM-Select, and settlement of mixed linear models under progressively exclusive relationship (SUPER). The genomic prediction methods implemented in this new release of the GAPIT include gBLUP based on CMLM, ECMLM, and SUPER. Additionally, the GAPIT was updated to improve its existing output display features and to add new data display and evaluation functions, including new graphing options and capabilities, phenotype simulation, power analysis, and cross-validation. These enhancements make the GAPIT a valuable resource for determining appropriate experimental designs and performing GWAS and genomic prediction. The enhanced R-based GAPIT software package uses state-of-the-art methods to conduct GWAS and genomic prediction. The GAPIT also provides new functions for developing experimental designs and creating publication-ready tabular summaries and graphs to improve the efficiency and application of genomic research.},
