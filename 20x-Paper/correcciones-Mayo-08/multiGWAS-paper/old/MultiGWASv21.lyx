\begin_layout Abstract

\series bold
Summary:
\series default
 The Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) are essential to determine the
 genetic bases of either ecological or economic phenotypic variation across
 individuals within populations of the model and non-model organisms.
 For this research question, the GWAS replication testing different parameters
 and models to validate the results' reproducibility is common.
 However, straightforward methodologies that manage both replication and
 tetraploid data are still missing.
 To solve this problem, we designed the MultiGWAS, a tool that does GWAS
 for diploid and tetraploid organisms by executing in parallel four software,
 two designed for polyploid data (GWASpoly and SHEsis) and two for diploids
 data (GAPIT and TASSEL).
 MultiGWAS has several advantages.
 It runs either in the command line or in a graphical interface; it manages
 different genotype formats, including VCF.

\color blue
Moreover, it allows control for population structure, relatedness, and several
 quality control checks on genotype data.
 Besides, MultiGWAS can test for additive and dominant gene action models,
 and through a proprietary scoring function, select the best model to report
 its associations.

\color inherit
 Finally, it generates several reports that facilitate identifying false
 associations from both the significant and the best-ranked association
 SNP among the four software.
 We tested MultiGWAS with public tetraploid potato data for tuber shape
 and several simulated data under both additive and dominant models.
 These tests demonstrated that MultiGWAS is better at detecting reliable
 associations than using each of the four software individually.
 Moreover, the parallel analysis of polyploid and diploid software that
 only offers MultiGWAS demonstrates its utility in understanding the best
 genetic model behind the SNP association in tetraploid organisms.
 Therefore, MultiGWAS probed to be an excellent alternative for wrapping
 GWAS replication in diploid and tetraploid organisms in a single analysis
 environment.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) comprise statistical tests that
 identify which variants through the whole genome of a large number of individua
ls are associated with a specific trait (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "cantor2010prioritizing,begum2012comprehensive"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 This methodology started with humans and several model plants, such as
 rice, maize, and 
\emph on
Arabidopsis
\emph default
 (

LatexCommand cite
key "lauc2010genomics,tian2011genome,cao2011whole,korte2013advantages,han2013sequencing"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Because of the advances in the high-throughput sequencing technology and
 the decline of the sequencing cost in recent years, there is an increase
 in the availability of genome sequences of different organisms at a faster
 rate (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ekblom2011applications,ellegren2014genome"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Thus, the GWAS is becoming the standard tool to understand the genetic
 bases of either ecologically or economically relevant phenotypic variation
 for both model and non-model organisms.
 This increment includes complex species such as polyploids (Figure

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GWAS for polyploid species has fourth related challenges.
 First, replication among tools is critical to validate GWAS results and
 capture positive associations (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Chanock2007,De2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 
\color blue
Because each tool has its assumptions (i.e., data quality control, false-positive
 control, and model optimizations, among others), leading to different results
 such as p-values, significance thresholds, and genomic control inflation
 factors
\color inherit
.
 Consequently, each tool can be considered an independent environment to
 replicate a GWAS analysis.
 For example, the significance threshold for 
\emph on
p-value
\emph default
 changes through four GWAS software (i.e., PLINK, TASSEL, GAPIT, and FaST-LMM)
 when the sample size varies (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Yan2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 It means that well-ranked SNPs from one package can be ranked differently
 in another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, there are very few tools focused on integrating several GWAS software
 to compare different parameters and conditions across them.
 As far as we know, there is only two software with this service in mind:
 iPAT and easyGWAS.The iPAT allows running in a graphic interface three well-know
n command-line GWAS software such as GAPIT, PLINK, and FarmCPU (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Zhang2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 However, the output from each package is separated.
 On the other hand, the easyGWAS allows running a GWAS analysis on the web
 using different algorithms and combining several GWAS results.
 This analysis runs independently of both the computer capacity and the
 operating system.
 Nevertheless, it needs either several datasets to obtain the different
 GWAS results to make replicates or GWAS results already computed.
 In either case, the results from different algorithms are also separated
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Grimm2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Thus, although both software iPAT and easyGWAS integrate with different
 programs or algorithms, an output that allows to compare similitude and
 differences in the association is missing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Third, although there are different GWAS software available to repeat the
 analysis under different conditions (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Gumpinger2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), most of them are designed exclusively for the diploid data matrix (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bourke2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Therefore, it is often necessary to 
\begin_inset Quotes qld
\end_inset

diploidizing
\begin_inset Quotes qrd
\end_inset

 the polyploid genomic data to replicate the analysis.
 
\color blue
 This process could withdraw how allele dosage affects the phenotype expression
 in polyploid species (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ferrao2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 However, some genome sections of autopolyploid species did not duplicate,
 leading to loci's disomic inheritance (Ohno, 1970, Lynch and Conery, 2000,
 Dufresne et al., 2014).
 Moreover, the inheritance mechanism of most of the polyploid species is
 still unknown.
 Therefore, software that accounts for both polyploid and diploid data facilitat
es analyzing both inheritance types in polyploids.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, for polyploid species, any tool that integrates and compares different
 gene action among software is key to understanding how redundancy or complex
 interaction among alleles affects the phenotype expression and the evolution
 of new phenotypes (

key "Bourke2018,Rosyara2016,Ferrao2018"

\end_layout

This study developed the MultiGWAS tool that performs GWAS analyses for

 This wrapping tool deals with different input file formats that come from
 several polyploid genotypes calling software, including VCF.
 Besides, MultiGWAS manages data preprocessing, searches for associations
 by running four GWAS software in parallel, and creates a score to choose
 between gene action models in GWASPoly and TASSEL.
 This study describes the utilities of MultiGWAS and its evaluation through
 simulation studies and one public GWAS data set, demonstrating its advantages.

 Next, during the multi-analysis, each GWAS tool runs in parallel.
 Subsequently, in the integration step, the MultiGWAS tool scans the output
 data files from the four packages (i.e., GWASPoly, SHEsis, GAPIT, and TASSEL);
 post-processes the data; and finally, it generates a summary of all results
 that contain: associations tables, Venn diagrams showing associated SNPs
 shared among tools, SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD), Manhattan and
 quantile-quantile (QQ) plots, chord diagrams showing the position in the
 chromosome of the associated SNPs and finally SNP profiles (see Section

Test model:

\begin_layout Standard
One of the main factors in detecting real trait-marker associations depends
 on the gene action models.
 A unique feature offered by MultiGWAS is to test the different gene action
 models supported by the tools (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Multi-analysis-stage"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

).
 The additive model is the default model supported by all the tools.
 However, GWASpoly supports eight, TASSEL three, GAPIT two, and SHEsis only
 supports one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To integrate the different models in one wrapping tool, MultiGWAS offers
 three testing options:

 (supported by all tools except SHEsis), and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 (for testing all effects supported by the tools, including both additive
 and dominant effects).
 In any of the three tests, MultiGWAS reports its top N associations with

\begin_layout Standard

\color blue
MultiGWAS works with quantitative phenotypes and runs two types of GWAS,
 either with control for population structure and relatedness between samples
 or without any control.
 The first is known in the literature as the Q+K or 
\emph on
full model
\emph default
, where Q refers to population structure and K to relatedness; and the second
 is known as the 
\emph on

\emph default
 (

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both models are linear regression approaches, and GWAS tools used by MultiGWAS
 implements some variations of those models.
 The 
\emph on

\emph default
 is modeled with Generalized Linear Models (GLMs, Phenotype + Genotype),
 and the 
\emph on

 The default model used by MultiGWAS is the

In this equation, the

 is the vector of observed phenotypes.
 Moreover, the

Genome-wide significance: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
GWAS searches SNPs associated with the phenotype in a statistically significant
 manner.
 A threshold or significance level 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is specified and compared with the 
\emph on
p-value
\emph default
 derived for each association score.
 Standard significance levels are 0.01 or 0.05 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Gumpinger2018,Rosyara2016"

\end_inset

), and MultiGWAS uses an 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 of 0.05 for the four GWAS packages.
 However, in GWASpoly and TASSEL, which calculates the SNP effect for each
 genotypic class using different gene action models (see 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Multi analysis stage

\end_inset

), the threshold is adjusted according to these two packages.
 Therefore, the number of tested markers
\emph on
 
\emph default
may be different in each model (see below), impacting the 
\emph on

 thresholds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Multiple testing correction:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the massive number of statistical tests performed by GWAS, it is
 necessary to perform a correction method for multiple hypothesis testing
 and adjusting the 
\emph on
p-value
\emph default
 threshold accordingly.
 Two standard methods for multiple hypothesis testing are the false discovery
 rate (FDR) and the Bonferroni correction.
 The latter is the default method used by MultiGWAS, which is one of the
 most rigorous methods.
 However, instead of adjusting the 
\emph on
p-values
\emph default
, MultiGWAS adjust the threshold below which a 
\emph on
p-value
\emph default
 is considered significant.
 That is 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha/m$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is the significance level, and 
\emph on
m 
\emph default
is the number of tested markers from the genotype matrix.

%There is some criticism associated with the statement that real associations

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

The use of stringent significance levels could discard many 
\emph on

 associations closer to significant threshold, generating a high number
 of false negatives (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

).
 To avoid this problem, MultiGWAS provides the option to specify the number
 of best-ranked associations (lower 
\emph on
p-values
\emph default
), adding the corresponding 
\emph on
p-value
\emph default
 to each association found.
 In this way, it is possible to enlarge the number of results and their
 replicability across the different programs.
 Nevertheless, the report displays each association with its corresponding
 
\emph on
p-value
\emph default
.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Quality control filters:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A control step is necessary to check the input data for the genotype or
 phenotype errors or low quality, leading to spurious GWAS results.
 MultiGWAS provides the option to select and define thresholds for the following
 filters that control the data quality: Minor Allele Frequency (MAF), individual
 missing rate (MIND), SNP missing rate (GENO), and Hardy-Weinberg threshold
 (HWE).
 All of these filters are built-in implementations of multiGWAS, except

 GWASpoly uses a Q+K linear mixed model with biallelic SNPs that account
 for population structure and relatedness.
 Also, to calculate the SNP effect for each genotypic class, GWASpoly provides
 eight gene action models: general, additive, simplex dominant alternative,
 simplex dominant reference, duplex dominant alternative, duplex dominant,
 diplo-general, and diplo-additive.
 Consequently, the number of statistical tests performed can be different
 in each action model, and thus thresholds below which the

 model has an inflation factor

 Conversely, the score is low when the

 either low (close to 0) or high (
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda>2$

\begin_layout Standard

\color purple
GWAS packages compute 
\emph on
p-value 
\emph default
as a measure of association between each SNP and the trait of interest.
 The statistically significant associations are those their 
\emph on
p-value 
\emph default
drops below a predefined significance threshold.
 Thus, GWAS analysis performs many tests to look for possible associations,
 one for each SNP.
 Therefore, the next step is to apply some correction in the 
\emph on
p-values
\emph default
 to reduce the possibility of identifying false positives, or SNPs with
 false associations with the phenotype, but that reach the significance
 threshold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color purple
MultiGWAS provides two methods for adjusting 
\emph on
p-values
\emph default
 and significance threshold: the false discovery rate (FDR) that adjust
 
\emph on
p-values, 
\emph default
and the Bonferroni correction that adjusts the threshold.
 By default, MultiGWAS uses the Bonferroni correction that uses the significance
 level 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha/m$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 defined by the user in the configuration file, and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is the number of tested markers to adjust the significance threshold in
 the GWAS study.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color purple
However, the significance threshold can be different for each GWAS package
 as some of them use several action models to calculate the SNP effect of
 each genotypic class.
 For both GAPIT and SHEsis packages, 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is equal to the total number of SNPs.
 In contrast, for both GWASpoly and TASSEL packages, which use eight and
 three gene action models, respectively, 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is equal to the number of tests performed in each model, which is different
 between models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color purple
Furthermore, most GWAS packages compute both 
\emph on
p-values
\emph default
 and thresholds differently, with the consequence that significant associations
 identified by one package do not reach the threshold of significance in
 the others.
 Thus, it could result in the loss of real associations, the so-called false
 negatives.
 MultiGWAS reports two sets of associations to overcome these difficulties:
 significant and best-ranked (those closest to being statistically significant),
 as described below.

All four GWAS packages adopted by MultiGWAS use linear regression approaches.
 However, they often produce different association results for the same
 input.
 Computed 
\emph on
p-values 
\emph default
for the same set of SNPs are different between packages.
 Therefore, SNPs with significant 
\emph on
p-values
\emph default
 for one package maybe not significant for the others.
 Alternatively, well-ranked SNPs in one package may be ranked differently
 in another.

\begin_layout Paragraph
QQ plots for GWAS associations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The QQ plot shows how well most SNPs fit the null hypothesis of no association
 with the phenotype.
 Both distributions should coincide, and most SNPs should lie on the red
 diagonal line.
 Deviations for many SNPs may reflect inflated 
\emph on
p-values
\emph default
 due to population structure or cryptic relatedness.
 Nevertheless, few SNPs deviate from the diagonal for a truly polygenetic
 trait (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Power2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 MultiGWAS adds the top of each QQ plot the corresponding inflation factor
 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 to assess the test statistic inflation degree.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Manhattan plot for GWAS associations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MultiGWAS uses classical Manhattan plots to visualize each package's results.
 In both plots, the points are the SNPs and their 
\emph on
p-values
\emph default
 are transformed into scores like 
\begin_inset Formula $-log_{10}(\mathB{p-values})$
\end_inset

 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig: Reports"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The Manhattan plot shows the strength of association of the SNPs (y-axis)
 distributed at their genomic location (x-axis), so the higher the score,
 the stronger the association.
 MultiGWAS adds distinctive marks to the plot; significant SNPs are above
 a red line, best-ranked SNPs are above a blue line, and SNPs shared between
 packages are colored green.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Tables and Venn diagrams for single and shared SNPs:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MultiGWAS provides tabular and graphic views to report the best-ranked and
 significant SNPs identified by the four GWAS packages in an integrative
 way (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig: Reports"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Both 
\emph on
p-values
\emph default
 and significance levels have been scaled as 
\begin_inset Formula $-log_{10}(\mathB{p-values})$
\end_inset

 to give high scores to the best statistically evaluated SNPs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, best-ranked SNPs correspond to the top-scored 
\emph on
N
\emph default
 SNPs, whether they were assessed significant or not by its package, and
 with
\emph on
 N
\emph default
 defined by the user in the configuration file.
 These SNPs appear in both an SNPs table and in a Venn diagram.
 The table lists them by package and sorts by decreasing score, whereas
 the Venn diagram emphasizes if they were best-ranked either in a single
 package or in several at once (shared).Second, the significant SNPs correspond
 to the ones valued statistically significant by each package.
 They also appear in a Venn diagram and the SNPs table, marked with significance
 TRUE (T).

\begin_layout Standard
Within the figure, at the left, the individuals are grouped in a dendrogram
 by their genotype.
 At the right, there is the name or ID of each individual.
 At the bottom, the genotypes are ordered from left to right, starting from
 the major to the minor allele (i.e., AAAA, AAAB, AABB, ABBB, BBBB).
 At the top, there is a description of the trait based on a histogram of
 frequency (top left) and an assigned color for each numerical phenotype
 value using a color scale (top right).
 Thus, each individual appears as a colored line by its phenotype value
 on its genotype column.
 For each column, there is a solid cyan line with each column's mean and
 a broken cyan line that indicates how far the cell deviates from the mean
 (Figure

MultiGWAS is a wrapping tool developed in R (R>=3.6).
 However, it is not an R package or run in the R interface.
 Instead, it runs on Linux environments because it integrates four external
 GWAS software implemented in different languages.
 GWASpoly and GAPIT are R packages; SHEsis is a binary program developed
 in C++, and TASSEL is a java package that runs through a pipeline implemented
 in Perl.
 Consequently, users can run MultiGWAS either by a command-line interface
 (an R script) or a graphic user interface (a Java application).

MultiGWAS strengthened the replicability of these associated SNPs by the
 four GWAS packages.
 Also, the linkage disequilibrium analyzed confirmed this replicability.
 Furthermore, when the Naive GWAS model was used to analyze the same dataset,
 MultiGWAS showed all four tools simultaneously detected the SNP c1_8019
 as a significant associated SNP, highlighting it as a reliable association.

For the additive effect simulation, GWASpoly (green) and SHEsis (blue) had
 the best performance based on True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative
 Rate (TNR) in the detection of the best-ranked SNP.
 The two diploid software GAPIT and TASSEL, have similar results but lower
 performance in both statistics.
 In parallel,MultiGWAS performance change depending on the number of software
 involved in the predicted SNP intersection; the TPR was progressively lower,
 and TNR progressively higher.
 Consequently, in the two more restrictive cases (i.e., the intersection of
 predicted SNP by three and all the four software, MultiGWAS_3 and MultiGWAS_4
 respectively),the TPR was similar to obtained by TASSEL and GAPIT.
 However, the TNR was higher than even GWASpoly and SHEsis (Figure

For the dominant effect simulation, GAPIT (cyan) tends to have a higher
 TPR than the other three software.
 Moreover, SHEsis had a lower value of both TPR and TNR since it was designed
 only to detect associations with additive effects.
 Comparing these four software's performance with a wrapping tool as MultiGWAs,
 it had a similar performance to the additive effect simulation.
 As the more restrictive the intersection is, the TPR was progressively
 lower and TNR progressively higher.
 However, in the two more restrictive cases (i.e., the intersection of predicted
 SNP by three and all the four software, MultiGWAS_3 and MultiGWAS_4 respectivel
y), the TNR was higher than all the four software (Figure

 Therefore true and false associations are reaching the significance threshold.
 In comparison, MultiGWAS_4, GWASpoly, and GAPIT are more conservative,
 with closer TPR but high TNR (Figure

For dominant effects simulation, GWASpoly had the higher TPR with a lower
 TNR.
 Thus, this software was the most sensitive detecting significative associations
, but at the same time, it was one of the least specific.
 In comparison, MultiGWAS_4 and GAPIT had TPR slightly lower than of GWASpoly,
 but with the highest TNR.
 This pattern suggests that both are less sensitive in detecting significative
 association but more specific than GWASpoly.
 Therefore, MultiGWAS_4 provides very accurate associations (Figure

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reanalysis of both potato and simulated data with MultiGWAS showed that
 this wrapping tool is handy to improve the GWAS in both diploid and tetraploid
 species for additive and dominant gene action effects.
 Through MultiGWAS performance, we could test its effectiveness to answer
 some of the challenges of analyzing polyploid organisms.
 They include integrating and replicating among parameters and software,
 the diploidization of polyploid data, and the incorporation of different
 inheritance mechanisms (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "dufresne2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main advantage of MultiGWAS is that it replicates the GWAS analysis
 among four software and integrates the results obtained across software,
 models, and parameters.
 Therefore, in MultiGWAS, users do not have to choose between specificity
 or sensitivity because they can observe their effect in the analysis within
 the same wrapping environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another difficulty for replication among software is the variability of
 formats for the genomic input data.
 MultiGWAS receives the genotype data in five different formats, including
 two software outputs used to call polyploid allele dosage.
 Currently, the most common format for next-generation sequencing variant
 data is the VCF (Variant Call Format) (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Danecek2011"
literal "false"

\end_inset

; 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ebbert2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 One of the advantages of VCF is its versatility in summarizing important
 genome information for hundreds or thousands of individuals and SNP, including
 information about ploidy levels.
 MultiGWAS simplifies using the GWAS software because it allows the VCF
 files as an input (but see VarStats tool in VTC).

Moreover, the MultiGWAS is the unique wrapping tool we are aware of that
 facilitates understanding the effect of diploidizing the tetraploid data
 in the analysis's performance directly.
 The SNP profile allows identifying what the significant associations detected
 by more than one software are.
 Furthermore, although MultiGWAS checks for significative SNPs based on
 the 
\emph on
p-value
\emph default
, it is essential to go back to the data and check if the SNP is a true
 association between the genotype and phenotype.
 For this purpose, the SNP profile gives visual feedback for the accuracy
 of the association.

Furthermore, the MultiGWAS allows comparing among the gene action models
 that offer GWASPoly and TASSEL.
 GWASpoly (

LatexCommand cite
key "Rosyara2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) provides models of polyploid gene models action, including additive, diploidiz
ed additive, duplex dominant, simplex, and general.
 On the other hand, TASSEL (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bradbury2007"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) also models different gene action types for general, additive, and dominant
 diploids.
 To choose among models, we propose an automatic selection of the gene action
 model for both tools based on a balance between three criteria: the inflation
 factor, the replicability of identified SNPs, and the significance of identifie
d SNPs.
 This inflation index is a new tool for comparison that does not offer either
 GWASPoly or TASSEL.
 This automatic strategy will help to understand the gene action model for
 the trait of interest.
 Although the main focus is on the resultant SNPs, the model has assumptions
 that reflect a specific phenotype's gene actions.

Finally, MultiGWAS, through the active comparison among models, addresses
 the search of the inheritance mechanisms by comparing among two designed
 for polysomic inheritance software (

LatexCommand cite
key "Rosyara2016,Shen2016"

\end_inset

) with two software for disomic inheritance (

LatexCommand cite
key "Purcell2007,Bradbury2007"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Understanding the inheritance mechanisms for polyploid organisms is an
 open question.
 For autopolyploids, most loci have a polysomic heritage.
 However, sections of the genome that did not duplicate lead to disomic
 inheritance for some loci (

LatexCommand cite
key "ohno1970,lynch2000,dufresne2014"

).
 Thus it is a valuable tool for researchers because it looks for significant
 associations that involve both types of inheritance.

Future remarks

\begin_layout Standard
The evolution and population genomics of polyploids is an exciting novel
 area of research.
 The advancement of next-gen sequencing techniques produces more empirical
 polyploid data in different model and non-model organisms (

).

Many assumptions developed for diploids in the GWAS analysis do not apply
 entirely for polyploids (

Fortunately, in the last five years, different models to calculate several
 parameters for population genomics on polyploids are testing and developing
 in simulated and empirical data (

For MutiGWAS, we started with the most simple ploidy, such as tetraploids.

%Moreover, we did not filter data yet for HWE in tetraploids before GWAS
 as MultiGWAs do it for diploid data.

\end_layout

\end_inset

Nevertheless, future MultiGWAS versions should include more complex ploidies
 than tetraploids and the explicit calculation of parameters either for
 filtering polyploid data before GWAS analysis or complementing other population
s genomics' parameters of the data analyzed.
